## About the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a computer the size of a credit card. By default, the Pi runs a customized version of Debian Linux called Raspbian.

## Installing OpenSesame

You can install OpenSesame in Raspbian with the script shown in %InstallScript. Change `$OSVER` to match the latest version of OpenSesame.

## Running OpenSesame

To start OpenSesame, navigate to the folder where OpenSesame has been installed and execute `opensesame` or `opensesamerun`:

{% highlight bash %}
cd OpenSesame-release-0.27.4
./opensesame
{% endhighlight %}

## Limitations

At the time of testing, the Raspberry Pi does not support hardware-accelerated graphics. This means that only the [legacy] back-end works.
