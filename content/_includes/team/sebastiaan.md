I'm currently working as a post-doc with Jonathan Grainger and Françoise Vitu at the LPC in Marseille. My research focuses on the role that factors such as attention and working memory play in eye movements: What determines where we look? And what do eye movements tell us about what goes on in our heads?

OpenSesame is the more pragmatic side of my job. With this project, we aim to provide experimental psychologists and neuroscientists with a free (in every sense of the word) high quality experiment builder.
