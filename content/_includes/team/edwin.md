I'm currently a master student of Neuroscience and Cognition, as well as a research assistant at Utrecht University. For the OpenSesame project, I maintain the portable package and help with development (mostly plug-ins).

Being young and idealistic, I am a strong believer in the principles of open source software. I think OpenSesame is a great example of how open source software can really be a good alternative to - often very expensive - commercial software.
